// We will use these selectors in out components.

// By this usage, the "state" parameter of selectors in the reducer files will be the state slice of the same reducer in that file.
// Because of we are using the same selector name in the reducer file, we can't use same name again.
// Thus, we used "namespace import syntax" (i.e. "* as fromEntities").
